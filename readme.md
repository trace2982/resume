# Assignment Overview - Module 1

Welcome aboard the school bus of web development! Just like driving a school bus, developing quality web applications requires understanding and operating several controls. In this assignment, we'll focus on four essential tools: Git, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), Playwright, and Node.js.

Consider **Git** as your brake system. It allows you to stop and inspect the changes in your code at any point, and even revert to a previous state if necessary.

**VSCode** is like your steering wheel. It guides you through your codebase, offering features and extensions that aid in navigating and managing your code effectively.

**Playwright** is your gas pedal. It propels your development forward by automating browser tasks and ensuring your web application runs as expected through end-to-end tests.

**Node.js** is your clutch, connecting your local development environment to the server-side world, enabling you to host and serve your applications efficiently.

Just like learning to drive, you may be familiar with some controls, like HTML (the chassis of our bus), but in this assignment, we aim to make sure you're comfortable with all of these tools, operating them together to drive your web development forward smoothly. 

Our final destination? Creating your resume in plain HTML. This destination is chosen purposefully because we will be focusing on specific topics and will need the resume to be in plain HTML for future assignments in the course. Moreover, crafting your resume in plain HTML ensures it works well with assistive technologies like screen readers, boosting the accessibility of your web content.

To see the green checkmark of success on GitHub Actions, which signifies your code has passed all the automated Playwright tests, will be a part of this journey. This experience will give you a first-hand view of how continuous integration works in a real-world development scenario.

We're using GitHub Classroom for this assignment. It will automatically score your website based on the Playwright tests. Please note, this score is not automatically added to the Learning Management System (LMS). The grading for this assignment is all-or-nothing. If all tests pass, you'll receive full credit for the assignment.

Your task is to create your resume using plain HTML without any CSS or JavaScript. **SERIOUSLY, DO NOT USE CSS OR JAVASCRIPT AT ALL.** We just want a plain HTML document to get started with. You are required to pass the end-to-end (e2e) Playwright tests located in the [tests folder](tests/resume.spec.js). Below are detailed instructions to guide you through this assignment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. Use Git for version controlling your code.
2. Use Visual Studio Code to navigate and manage your codebase effectively.
3. Run end-to-end tests using the Playwright library.
4. Use Node.js to host and serve a static JSON file.
5. Demonstrate understanding of semantic HTML.
6. Create a resume using plain HTML which adheres to the guidelines provided.

Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. Let's start the engine and begin this exciting ride in the world of web development!
