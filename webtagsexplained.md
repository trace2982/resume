# Introduction to HTML, Web Browsers, and Web Servers

## History of HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It was invented in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, the same man who invented the World Wide Web. The first official version of HTML was HTML 2.0 in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used, currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01.

## Web Browsers

A web browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve, and display content on the World Wide Web. It interprets HTML code including text, images, hypertext links, Javascript, and CSS.

The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus), was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. Subsequently, a variety of web browsers such as Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox have been developed.

## Web Servers

A web server is a computer system that hosts websites. It runs web server software, such as Apache or Microsoft IIS, that provides web services. When it receives a request for a web page, it sends the page to the user's browser.

The first web server was also created by Tim Berners-Lee and was used to host the first website, info.cern.ch, in 1991. Nowadays, there are countless web servers around the world hosting websites of all types and sizes.

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics or meaning of the content. For example, a `<p>` tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is in contrast to non-semantic elements, like `<div>` and `<span>`, which don't provide any information about the type of content they contain.

Semantic HTML tags include `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>`, among others. They make the web page more accessible and the HTML easier to read and understand. Semantic tags are also important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

In HTML5, a number of new semantic elements were added to the standard, including `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<nav>`, providing developers with more options for clearly labeling their content.

## Conclusion

The development of HTML, web browsers, and web servers has paved the way for the modern World Wide Web. Understanding the history and functionality of these technologies is fundamental to web development. In addition, using semantic HTML tags can greatly improve the clarity and accessibility of your web pages, making the web a more inclusive place for everyone.

## HTML Tags to Use

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration helps the web browser to understand the version of HTML used in the document. In this case, we're using HTML5.

- `<html lang="en">`: This is the root element of an HTML document. The `lang` attribute is used to define the language used in the document (en stands for English).

- `<head>`: This element is used to contain all the head elements, which can include scripts, instruct the browser where to find style sheets, provide meta information, and more.

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This meta element defines the character set for the document and it must be declared as early as possible in the HTML document.

- `<meta name="description" content="This is an example resume.">`: This meta element provides a description of the webpage, which is often used by search engines when displaying search results.

- `<meta name="keywords" content="resume, jobs, career">`: This meta element is used to provide keywords that describe the webpage. These can also be used by search engines.

- `<title>`: This element is used to set the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
