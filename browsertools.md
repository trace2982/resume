# Using Browser's Developer Tools

## Install
* Chrome - [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - All the browsers have some version of the development tools but this is the standard we will use.

The Developer Tools, bundled and built into most modern web browsers, offer a wealth of information about the web pages you visit. They allow you to view the page's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources and details. Here's a basic guide on how to use them:

1. **Opening Developer Tools**:
    - **Google Chrome, Edge**: Right-click on any webpage and select 'Inspect' or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac.
    - **Firefox**: Right-click and select 'Inspect Element' or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac.

2. **HTML and CSS Inspection**:
    - In the 'Elements' (Chrome/Edge) or 'Inspector' (Firefox) tab, you'll see the HTML structure of the page. You can hover over the lines to highlight sections of the webpage in the browser.
    - Clicking on an HTML element will display the CSS rules applicable to it on the right pane. Here you can view, edit and experiment with the CSS properties.

3. **Console**:
    - Switch to the 'Console' tab to view any error messages or logs output by JavaScript code. This is also where you can run your own JavaScript code.

4. **Network Analysis**:
    - The 'Network' tab displays all network requests made by the page (like loading scripts, images, AJAX calls, etc.). You can view the request and response details by clicking on a network request.

5. **Performance Profiling**:
    - The 'Performance' tab (Chrome/Edge) or 'Performance' tool (Firefox) allows you to record and analyze the page's runtime performance. This is useful for understanding bottlenecks and optimizing your website.

6. **Device Emulation**:
    - You can simulate mobile devices to see how your website will appear on different screen sizes and resolutions. Look for the device icon in the toolbar of the 'Elements' or 'Inspector' tab.

Remember, the Developer Tools can do a lot more than this! Feel free to explore and experiment on your own.
